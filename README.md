## Emulators

[GXemul](https://gavare.se/gxemul/)

Dreamcast emulator, e.g. boot a ISO:

```
gxemul -XEdreamcast -dco23965696:data.raw 
```

# NetBSD

NetBSD officially supports Dreamcast, at least to the point, that it works in an Emulator. I didn't test it on real hardware right now.


[NetBSD on Dreamcast](https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/dreamcast/)

[Booting NetBSD/dreamcast with GDEMU](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-dreamcast/2023/04/05/msg000323.html)

"I've successfully booted it on my Dreamcast with a GDEMU by taking the generated `data.raw` generated by `dc-burn-netbsd` and converting it to a cdi with cdi4dc (https://github.com/Kazade/img4dc)."



[Create Live CD](https://github.com/abs0/dc-burn-netbsd)

The creation of a Live-CD to boot on the Dreamcast works flawless.

Fromt NetBSD, install `dc-tools` from pkgsrc.

Create Live-CD with base system, create data.raw to boot.

```
dc-burn-netbsd -s base -l
```

data.raw from the build-script:
```
gxemul -XEdreamcast -dco23965696:data.raw 
```

see https://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html

```
dd if=/dev/zero bs=2352 count=300 of=audio.raw 
wodim dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -audio audio.raw
wodim dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -xa std-live.raw 
```

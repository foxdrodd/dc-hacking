# Dreamcast Hacking

Collection of some Dreamcast hacking information with other OSs like Linux, NetBSD.

# Information sources

[Rich Knowledge Base of Dreamcast hacking](https://mc.pp.se/dc/sw.html)

Many great articles of technical details of the Dreamcast, like howto burn bootable CD-Rs, format of Bootloaders, System calls.

[Dreamcast 32MB RAM upgrade](https://blog.ldtlb.com/2020/06/21/dreamcast-32mb-ram-upgrade.html)

"This article describes how to upgrade a Dreamcast from 16MB to 32MB of system SDRAM. I have done this exactly once, so this is still rather experimental. Please only attempt this with a spare Dreamcast you donâ€™t mind destroying."

## Linux on Dreamcast

[Working dreamcast-linux](http://www.lxdream.org/files/)

Old Files from 2001 that contain a working dreamcast-linux

[Dreamcast Linux Docker Build](https://github.com/andersevenrud/dreamcast-linux)

Nice Docker Container that cross-compiles a dreamcast linux kernel, uses sh-boot loader (currently, doesnt boot for me and needs some customization eg CONFIG_SH_DREAMCAST)

## Emulators

[GXemul](https://gavare.se/gxemul/)

Dreamcast emulator, e.g. boot a ISO:

```
gxemul -XEdreamcast -dco23965696:data.raw 
```

# NetBSD

NetBSD officially supports Dreamcast and it really works, supports many features and peripherals.

[NetBSD on Dreamcast](https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/dreamcast/)

[Booting NetBSD/dreamcast with GDEMU](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-dreamcast/2023/04/05/msg000323.html)

"I've successfully booted it on my Dreamcast with a GDEMU by taking the generated `data.raw` generated by `dc-burn-netbsd` and converting it to a cdi with cdi4dc (https://github.com/Kazade/img4dc)."



[Create Live CD](https://github.com/abs0/dc-burn-netbsd)

The creation of a Live-CD to boot on the Dreamcast works flawless.

From NetBSD, install `dc-tools` from pkgsrc.

Create Live-CD with base system, create data.raw to boot.

```
dc-burn-netbsd -s base -l
```

data.raw from the build-script:
```
gxemul -XEdreamcast -dco23965696:data.raw 
```

---
Burn Image as Multi-Session CD-R
see https://mc.pp.se/dc/cdr.html

```
dd if=/dev/zero bs=2352 count=300 of=audio.raw 
wodim dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -audio audio.raw
wodim dev=/dev/sr0 -v -multi -xa std-live.raw 
```

---

Alternatively, the data.raw from dc-burn-netbsd can be converted to cdi format and put on gdemu to boot. For this you need the tool cdi4dc from [img4dc](https://github.com/Kazade/img4dc).

```
cdi4dc data.raw output-for-gdemu.cdi
```
The resulting file can be put on gdemu and be booted.
